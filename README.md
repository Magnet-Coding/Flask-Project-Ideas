<h2>Introduction of Flask</h2>
<p>Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.It is developed by Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.<br>
<dl>
  <li>WSGI:-</li>
  Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications.<br>
  <li>Jinja2:-</li>
  Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for python.A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.

<h3>List Of Python Projects:-</h2>
<ol>
  <!--#1th Project-->
  <li><b><i>Weather App Using Flask:-</b></i></li>
  The Wearther app is a cool project you can start with Flask. In this app, you can make a dashboard where the user enter the name of the city and do a search by 
  cliking a button.This App will show the current weather in that city.<br>
  You can leverage an API called OpenWeatherMap for doing this project simple.
  
  <!--#2th Project-->
  <li><b><i>Full Stack Social Network App:-</b></i></li>
  We all have been using social media account for various purpose.If you want to create a social ntework of your own, you can do that with the flask framework.
  You can make it by using Flask as a backend for this project.The Full-Stack Social Media App will have a database,server and front-end.
  
  <!--#3th Project-->
  <li><b><i>Portfolio Website Using Flask:-</b></i></li>
  <b>Every Software developer should have a portfolio website.</b>If you have done some projects already you will need a place where you can show them to your employer.
    A portfolio website can act as an online resume. You can create one using flask and basic front-end skill.<br>
    You can add all your project that you have done and show your skill to the world.
  
  <!--#4th Project-->
  <li><b><i>Rest API with Flask:-</b></i></li>
      In this project, You'all create a RESTful API using Python FLASK.REST(Representational State Transfer) is actually an architechtural style for designing network application.Web service APIs that adhere to the REST architectural constraints are known as RESTful APIs.<br>
      Along with Flask, you’ll be using some extra packages for building this project, including SQLAlchemy, which is an ORM (object-relational mapper). This will help you    interact with the database without having to write SQL code on your own.<br>
      This project will also use Flask Marshmellow for serialization. Also, Postman will help you make requests to the API and get the data back, and such sort of things.
  
  <!--#5th Project-->
   <li><b><i>Feedback Form using Flask:-</b></i></li>
      You can create a web application using Python Flask, which can act as a feedback form for your company or any services that you offer.<br>
      For example, if you’re a freelance web developer, you can use this feedback form to give to your clients or add to your website so that they can give you their opinion on       your service.<br>
      Continuous feedback from your clients will help you to improve your services and thereby land more clients. You can use a free service like mailtrap.io for your      application to send emails. You’ll also need Postgres and pgAdmin. After creating the web application, you can deploy it to Heroku for free.
  
  <!--#6th Project-->
  <li><b><i>Deploy Machine Learning Models using Flask:-</b></i></li>
  If you know how to create machine learning models, it is really a great skill to have. But if you can deploy the machine learning or deep learning models into production, it   will take your skills to the next level.<br> 
Most people prefer Flask for the deployment process since it is a comparatively simple framework. People don’t want the headache of using a complex framework in doing machine learning projects, which itself is a complex process.
  
  <!--#7th Project-->
  <li><b><i>Blog App using Flask:-</b></i></li>
  Just like a portfolio website, a blog is a great place to show your skills to the world. You can code your own blog if you want to publish articles and share your knowledge with the world.<br>
  However, if you’re doing blogging seriously, I would suggest you use WordPress, just for the SEO benefits and less headache. But, if you want to know how a blog works from the   inside, how can you create the functionalities, etc., you can create a blog with the help of the Flask framework with a little bit of HTML and CSS. If learning is your   mission, I would recommend you to create your blog by coding everything from scratch.
